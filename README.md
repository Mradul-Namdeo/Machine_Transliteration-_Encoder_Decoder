# Machine_Transliteration-_Encoder_Decoder
Machinetransliteration is the automated process of converting text from one writing system to another while 
preserving the pronunciation and meaning of the original words. In the context of languages with different scripts, such 
as English and Hindi, machine transliteration involves generating phonetically equivalent representations of words in the 
target script, making it easier for readers to pronounce and understand words written in a foreign script. This process is 
particularly valuable in multilingual communication, cross-language information retrieval and various natural language 
processing applications.
objective of the project: The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced machine transliteration 
system leveraging deep learning techniques. Specifically, the aim is to design and implement a deep learning model 
utilizing an Encoder-Decoder architecture enhanced with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and an attention mechanism.
