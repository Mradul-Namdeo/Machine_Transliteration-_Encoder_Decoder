# Machine_Transliteration-_Encoder_Decoder

# Introduction :-
Machinetransliteration is the automated process of converting text from one writing system to another while 
preserving the pronunciation and meaning of the original words. In the context of languages with different scripts, such 
as English and Hindi, machine transliteration involves generating phonetically equivalent representations of words in the 
target script, making it easier for readers to pronounce and understand words written in a foreign script. This process is 
particularly valuable in multilingual communication, cross-language information retrieval and various natural language 
processing applications.

# Abstract :-
Developed a high-accuracy machine transliteration model using an Encoder-Decoder architecture with GRU and attention mechanism. Opted for GRU for computational efficiency, outperforming LSTM. Achieved improved accuracy through meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Demonstrated model interpretability by analyzing attention patterns. Positioned the model as a valuable tool for multilingual communication, addressing the scarcity of reliable transliteration tools. Strong skills in deep learning, attention mechanisms, and model optimization.

# objective of the project :-
The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced machine transliteration 
system leveraging deep learning techniques. Specifically, the aim is to design and implement a deep learning model 
utilizing an Encoder-Decoder architecture enhanced with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and an attention mechanism.
